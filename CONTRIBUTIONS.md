```

## 📝 Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **JavaScript**: Follow ESLint configuration
- **File Naming**: Use camelCase for files and folders
- **Variables**: Use descriptive names
- **Functions**: Write clear, single-purpose functions
- **Comments**: Document complex logic and business rules

### Backend Development
```javascript
// Example: Proper error handling
try {
  const result = await someAsyncOperation();
  res.status(200).json({ success: true, data: result });
} catch (error) {
  console.error('Operation failed:', error);
  res.status(500).json({ 
    success: false, 
    message: 'Internal server error' 
  });
}
```

### Frontend Development
```jsx
// Example: Component structure
const ComponentName = ({ prop1, prop2 }) => {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialValue);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    // Side effects
  }, [dependencies]);
  
  return (
    <div className="component-container">
      {/* JSX content */}
    </div>
  );
};
```

### API Development
- Follow RESTful conventions
- Use appropriate HTTP status codes
- Implement proper input validation
- Include comprehensive error messages
- Document endpoints thoroughly

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Backend Testing
```bash
cd backend
npm run test
```

### Frontend Testing
```bash
cd frontend
npm test
```

### Test Requirements
- Write unit tests for new functions
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Test error scenarios and edge cases
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
